# Unhandled Requests Analysis Project

This GitHub repository hosts a project that focuses on the analysis of unhandled requests, which carry various aspects of potential importance. Unhandled requests refer to user queries or inputs that the system cannot currently handle or classify accurately. These unhandled requests can include novel examples of existing intents, completely novel topics, or seasonal peaks in user interactions.

In large deployments, the number of unhandled requests can reach tens of thousands daily, making manual inspection and analysis impractical. The goal of this project is to propose and implement an approach that addresses this challenge by:

1. **Surfacing Topical Clusters in Unhandled Requests (Clustering):** The project aims to develop methods to identify and group unhandled requests into topical clusters. By applying clustering algorithms, the system can automatically group similar unhandled requests together, allowing for efficient analysis and understanding of the underlying patterns.

2. **Extraction of Cluster Representatives:** Once the topical clusters are identified, the project seeks to extract representative samples or examples from each cluster. These representative samples will help in understanding the key characteristics, commonalities, and distinguishing features within each cluster.

3. **Cluster Naming (Labeling):** In order to provide a meaningful and interpretable representation of the identified clusters, the project aims to assign appropriate labels or names to each cluster. This step enables easier communication and understanding of the unhandled request clusters within the organization.

The ultimate goal of this project is to develop an automated approach that can handle the analysis of unhandled requests at scale, allowing for efficient insights and improvements in system performance.

Feel free to explore and contribute to this project. Your ideas, algorithms, and implementations to tackle the challenges mentioned above are highly encouraged. Additionally, documenting your findings, methodologies, and experimental results will be valuable for the evaluation and advancement of the project.

Good luck with your unhandled requests analysis project!
